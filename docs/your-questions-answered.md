## Question
How does Compliant Financial Infrastructure maintain the security of the environment and the protection of the environment for open source consumers? [#18](https://github.com/finos/cloud-service-certification/issues/18)

### Answer
Compliant Financial Infrastructure has a peer review process to ensure the content created is functional (works as intended) and at least 2 members feel the content meets the control objective it was created for. This is OSS and it should not be trusted completely. 

This is the purpose of the design of the artifacts as well. The intention to turn control implementations into code and provide the BDD test cases and the user stories is so consumers can rebuild the content themselves using the stories. They can verify the actions of the code actually do the tasks intended.
