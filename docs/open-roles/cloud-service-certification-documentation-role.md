### Cloud Service Certification Documentation Role

This role will research the specific Cloud Service and fill in the [document template](https://github.com/finos/cloud-service-certification/tree/master/templates) for each section making sure to provide specific technical examples and asserting an opinionated view of how to implement and meet the control objective.  This document will be vital to provide context to security teams, architecture review boards, internal compliance teams, developers, and infrastructure teams. 

* **Product created:** A template document that includes detail of the service as related to categories specific to security and compliance (encryption, network, storage, availability, etcâ€¦)
* **Who can perform this role:** Any project participant that has strong technical security knowledge and has the relevant knowledge of the service in the document.  So if you have been using a service (i.e. S3) for a while you would be able to write the document.   If you are strong with a platform (Azure, Google, AWS) and just not a specific service it is likely you have the skills to write this document with a little research and time with the CSP product teams.
* **Skills required**
  * Strong technical security and compliance knowledge
  * Deep knowledge of the cloud platform and specific service included in the document
  * Ability to perform deployment and use the service on the platform to ensure recommendations are accurately represented and are effective.
  * Ability to use GitHub
